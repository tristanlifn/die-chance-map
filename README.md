# automaticaly generated die chance chart
An automaticaly generated probabilaty chart of 3 die.

This file prints to the terminal a 3d chart of the probabilety of 3 dice.
It is a 3d matrix wich means the x and y is printed in the col and row, and the z is the 3d die.

you can select what number you want to cearch for and it tells you how many times it is in there and how many times it is found. it also tells you how many items there are in the matrix in total.
it gives you a percentage (rounded to 2 decimals) of the chance of roling the number you enterd.

if you enter a number bigger then 10 then hte axes will be compressed.

please make improvements or sugestions. i realy dont care what you do with this file, just give me credit.
